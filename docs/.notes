Notes for myself:

Config file doesn't specify url and baseurl at the moment. 
This way, this folder can be used both locally and probably in the repo (on github pages).
(Gemfile and Gemfile.lock are excluded in gitignore so that the most up-to date version is used in github pages.)

Minima theme is specified in config, but custom layouts files with the same name will override the theme's files.

The work on the site is completed. However, if I ever return to editing the site, the following could be done:
0) add photo to Home page
1) custom sass file: to define the color of header and footer (instead of doing it twice in the html files)
2) 404.html could be customized 
3) add "Go Home" button or link at the bottom of each page
4) clickable icons from Contact page could be replicated in the Home page
5) add "Interests" to the Home page
6) create a dark mode and a button (in navbar) that switches between modes
