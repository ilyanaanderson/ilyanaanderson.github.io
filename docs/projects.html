                <div class="mb-2">
                  Understanding Ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecule structure is crucial in many fields of medicine. 
                  Experimental measurements of several types of chemical reactivity can be utilized to derive such 
                  structure information. In the present work, I used customized transformer architecture to predict 
                  two types of reactivity at each position of RNA molecules as part 
                  of the

                    Stanford 
                    Ribonanza RNA Folding competition</a> on Kaggle. I experimented with rotary and sinusoidal 
                    embeddings, as well as feeding different types of sequence-related data (features) into the decoder 
                    part of my transformer models. My best approach yielded 0.15867 mean absolute error (MAE) 
                    score on the private leaderboard test data. This solution placed in the top 8% of contest 
                    submissions.

                  Language Inference Task</div>
                <div class="mb-2">In this project, I made several attempts to remove bias from the models trained 
                  for the natural language inference task, including two novel approaches. I explored the possibility 
                  that a model forced to generate a hypothesis based on a premise might be less prone to learning the 
                  dataset bias. Another attempt to reduce the learned bias was made by flipping premises and hypotheses 
                  for the contradiction examples during the training. Lastly, I implemented the DRiFT method reported in 
                  the literature. Most of the enhanced models demonstrated improved performance on the HANS dataset 
                  relative to the baseline results, suggesting a potential reduction in bias.</div>

                  hockey by choosing an appropriate action at every turn. Working within a team, we pursued various 
                  strategies, including the development of a computer vision system from scratch and reinforcement 
                  learning. The focus of my work was to implement imitation learning and dagger algorithms. The team 
                  selected my agent design as the basis for further experimentation. This agent placed second in a 
                  class-wide competition.</div>
