                <div class="mb-2">
                  Understanding the ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecule structure is crucial in many fields of medicine. 
                  Experimental measurements of several types of chemical reactivity can be utilized to derive such 
                  structural information. In the present work, I used a customized transformer architecture to predict 
                  two types of reactivity at each position of RNA molecules as part 
                  of the

                    Stanford 
                    Ribonanza RNA Folding competition</a> on Kaggle. I experimented with rotary and sinusoidal 
                    embeddings for encoding positional information, as well as with feature design. My best approach 
                    yielded a mean absolute error (MAE) score of 0.15867 on the private leaderboard test data. 
                    This solution placed in the top 8% of the contest 
                    submissions.

                  Language Inference Task</div>
                <div class="mb-2">In this project, I made several attempts to remove bias from models trained 
                  for the natural language inference task, including two novel approaches. I explored the possibility 
                  that forcing a model to generate a hypothesis based on a premise might reduce its tendency to learn 
                  dataset bias. Another attempt involved flipping premises and hypotheses 
                  for contradiction examples during training. Lastly, I implemented the DRiFT method reported in 
                  the literature. Most of the enhanced models demonstrated improved performance on the HANS dataset 
                  compared to the baseline, suggesting a potential reduction in bias.</div>

                  ice hockey by choosing an appropriate action at every turn. Working within a team, we pursued various 
                  strategies, including developing a computer vision system from scratch and using reinforcement learning. 
                  My focus was on implementing imitation learning and DAGGER algorithms. The team selected my agent design 
                  as the basis for further experimentation. This agent placed second in a class-wide competition.</div>
