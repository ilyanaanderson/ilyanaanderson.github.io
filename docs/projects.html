                      Understanding Ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecule structure is crucial in many fields of medicine. 
                      Experimental measurements of several types of chemical reactivity can be utilized to derive such 
                      structure information. In the present work, I used customized transformer architecture to predict 
                      two types of reactivity at each position of RNA molecules as part 
                      of the

                    <div class="mb-2">In this project, I make several attempts to remove bias from the models trained 
                      for the natural language inference task. I explore the possibility that a model forced to generate 
                      a hypothesis based on a premise might be less prone to learning the dataset bias. Another attempt 
                      to reduce the learned bias was made by flipping premises and hypotheses for the contradiction 
                      examples during the training. Lastly, I implemented the DRiFT method reported in the literature. 
                      Most of the enhanced models demonstrated improved performance on the HANS dataset relative to the 
                      baseline models, suggesting a potential reduction in bias. Nevertheless, while these results are 
                      indicative, they are not conclusive enough to firmly assert the complete removal of bias.</div>
